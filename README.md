# PUMA: Powder Utilization Modeling Application

PUMA a high performance modeling framework to simulate powder processing. It provides a scalable tool for manufacturers to simulate powder pre- and post-processing.

The tool can predict distortion, residual stress, and (for reactive processes) reaction completion fraction of complex parts after curing/debinding, sintering, and infiltration processes. These predictions are key metrics industry uses to optimize these processes to produce dense, defect-free, stable components.
